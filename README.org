* B2G Dialer Test

This program demonstrates how to communicate with the B2G RIL daemon,
for dialing the phone, dealing with SMS, and other actions requiring
access to the cell phone radio.

* Low Level Access

Kernel access for specific phones are vendor specific, included in the
phone's firmware distribution. To access these drivers, android uses
the libril library. Information on libril and android's telephony
architecture is available at

[[http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/development/pdk/docs/telephony.html]]

Source code for libril and rild is available in the B2G checkout as

glue/gonk/hardware/ril

* Socket Access

In order to access libril, android uses an ipc socket interface to the
rild daemon. The daemon simply creates a socket named "rild" and
manages transfers of ipc parcels
(http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html)
through it.

A sample emulator implementation of rild is available alongside the
libril source code. Actual rild implementations for phones are
proprietary and distributed by the vendor.

Due to wanting a single event source for dealing with events, the rild
socket requires exclusive access from a single process. In a normal
android installation, this would happen via the com.android.phone
process. In order to make our own code talk to the socket, the current
strategy is to change the socket name in the RIL.java file to
something other than "rild" (since we can't recompile vendor specific
rild). 

* Android Access

Android code specific to RIL communication is in 

glue/gonk/frameworks/base/telephony/java/com/android/internal/telephony/RIL.java

The Java code communicates with the rild socket via the Binder IPC
system, using objects known as Parcels. Parcels are simply flattened,
serialized data structures. libbinder exists for C++ in
glue/gonk/frameworks. 

To access sockets via C, android uses libcutils, also available in
glue/gonk/frameworks.

Each RIL Socket Write has the following format:

- Byte 0x00 - uint32_t - Header (Size of Following Parcel)
  - PARCEL BEGINS AFTER THIS FIELD
- Byte 0x04 - uint32_t - RIL Event ID (IDs available in glue/gonk/hardware/ril/include/telephony/ril.h)
- Byte 0x08 - uint32_t - Packet Serial Number (Used to track send/receive order)
- Byte 0x12 - void* - Data for event

The expectations of each RIL event are outlined in the comments for
the fields in the ril.h file.

* Debugging

The command "logcat -b radio" in the android shell will print all radio messages

Tracing the packet formats going between com.android.phone and the
rild socket can be achieved by watching strace on the rild
process. Due to the fact that rild spawns multiple threads, this
should be done with the fork option, i.e.

strace -p XXXX -f 

To trigger events that happens from outside the network, the
rild-debug socket is provided by rild. This socket responds to a
different set of commands, in order to inject RIL events into the ril
core. It's mainly used for testing new ril implementations.

* Tools

To automate some of the common tasks involved with resetting processes
on the phone, watching logs, etc... I've made a few different custom
targets in the CMake file. These can be run using 

make [target_name]

in the out-of-source build directory. The targets are:

- adbpush - Push b2g-dialer-test binary to phone.
- adbdial - Run b2g-dialer-test. Currently does not work.
- adbrwmount - Remount / and /system as rw for duration of session
  (i.e. until next reboot)
- adbjavaon/adbjavaoff - With the patch to the android code, java now
  tries to connect to /dev/socket/rild2 instead of /dev/socket/rild.
  This allows us to connect to rild via our own process when needed,
  but also means we can symlink rild2 to rild when we want to watch
  how android interacts with something (useful for analyzing code
  flow). adbjavaon creates the symlink (at which point b2g-dialer-test
  binary will fail due to needing exclusing socket access). adbjavaoff
  will remove the symlink and kill the android phone process, causing
  it to drop its connection to the socket.

* Goals

- Create patch to make android radio core not connect to rild socket
- Figure out/find documentation for commands for ril events
- Create function that will dial phone via socket calls
- Create function that will wait for an SMS message (async) via sockets
